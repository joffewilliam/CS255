Course Overview - CS-255 - SNHU

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass project we completed this semester involved designing a system for a new driver training company called DriverPass. The client was named Liam and his IT officer was also present at the meetings. The system they wanted built was designed to fill a gap in the market by providing better driver training which would lower failure rates that were on the rise. They wanted us to design a full stack, cloud-based system capable of handling customer registration, online classes and practice tests, scheduling training sessions, the ability to track student progress, and automatic updates from the DMV so they could update rules and practice test questions. They wanted to use third party payment solutions and third party hosting. This would alleviate their staff from most of the technical issues that might arise during a deployement like this.

What did you do particularly well?

  As time went on in the class, I believe I found my rhythm on how I preferred to make my diagrams. My UML Class diagram was the highlight of Project 2 in my eyes. The readability is very high, all of the relationships are neatly connected and labelled, and the color coding breaks everything up in a pleasing manner. This type of diagram is one of the most useful diagrams in my eyes. If I only use this in my personal projects moving forward, I believe the quality of my work will improve. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would redo my UML Use Case diagram for sure. Lucid Charts was giving me heaps of problems and I did not find a good alternative until a few weeks later. The layout of the actors is fine, but the connections are too confusing for me to ever repeat that. By organizing my use cases, I actually introduced a line that each arrow has to cross over and it isn't as clean as I'd like. I would just keep the internal box and straighten out my arrows to provide visual clarity. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I focused on understanding Liam's overall vision for DriverPass while also taking Ian's technical concerns about security, data integrity, and minimizing their IT burden into account. For instance, Liam wanted the site accessible from anywhere with a backup to view reports offline if needed. Given this stipulation, a cloud-based platform was the only way to move forward. Ian wanted to make sure each user had different rights depending on which role they had and this led to the detailed role-based access control and activity logging in my design. 
  Once I knew what Liam wanted, we took all of the functionalities and represented them for the client in the use case, class, activity, and sequence diagrams. It's incredibly important to consider user needs because without truly understanding what problems they're trying to solve and how they operate, you risk building a system that doesn't actually meet their real-world demands, leading to wasted effort and a solution that isn't adopted.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  Before this class, my method was to first come up with a problem I am solving and determine what my stack would be to solve the issue. I would write out a general framework of what I would need to create and then change it as I developed. 
Now that I've taken this class, I have approached starting a new project differently. The first thing I did for my new project is to write out a class diagrams for it. I spent a lot of time at this stage and even added it to my repo so I can refer to it while coding the framework. Although I didn't create diagrams for the ENTIRE project, I created diagrams for the bare bones of what I need. This way, I'll actually finish something that is designed the way I initially planned it. A step in the right direction.
